"""
Deterministic, non-AI validation helpers for AI-extracted financial documents.

These run *after* the LLM extraction step and add a trust/safety layer without
spending any extra tokens:

  - validate_financials(): recalculates subtotal/tax/grand total from the
    extracted line items and tax entries, then cross-checks that against the
    AI-reported grand total within a tolerance band. Flags a HIGH risk_level
    if they disagree by more than the tolerance.

  - intelligent_supplier_match(): exact-match first, then a fuzzy
    difflib.SequenceMatcher pass against existing Suppliers. Deliberately
    returns no match (rather than guessing) when multiple suppliers are
    ambiguously close, so a human reviews it instead of an auto-pick being
    silently wrong.

Both are pure Python — no LLM calls, no network — so they're fast and free
to run on every extraction.
